# Qualify preflight environment (why two Linux/bwrap hosts can disagree)

`inferrsi.harness.artifact_sandbox.replay()` runs a **probe** invocation inside
`bwrap --unshare-all …` with explicit `--ro-bind` of system Python, its stdlib,
lib dirs, a temp `/work`, `/proc` and `/dev`, before any control. If the probe
does not return `{"ready": True}`, it raises `SandboxUnavailable("Artifact
sandbox preflight failed; no host fallback")` and does **not** fall back to the
host. Qualification then reports INCONCLUSIVE with empty controls. That is the
designed failure mode, not a PASS/FAIL on the parser controls.

## PASS-host `preflight-diag` output (attached)

The PASS receipt in `receipts/qualify-8b4a0cf-debian13/` was produced on this
host:

- Linux 6.12.113+ x86_64, Debian GNU/Linux 13.7 (trixie), glibc 2.41
- `/usr/bin/python3` → `/usr/bin/python3.13` = CPython 3.13.5
- bubblewrap 0.12.0 (`/usr/bin/bwrap`)
- Runner-image *label* `debian-13.7/local-box-bwrap-0.12.0` (this is a label,
  not the GitHub `ubuntu-22.04` workflow image)
- **No** `sysctl`, AppArmor policy, or service change was made for the qualify
  run or for the diagnostic below

`environment.json` is the original qualify-run snapshot
(**2026-11-14 17:16:35 Asia/Shanghai**). It records the free-text note
"User namespaces already enabled" but does not include the sysctl / `bwrap`
probe facts that `reproduce.py preflight-diag` prints. Those facts from the
**same PASS host** are in
[`receipts/qualify-8b4a0cf-debian13/preflight-diag-pass-host.txt`](receipts/qualify-8b4a0cf-debian13/preflight-diag-pass-host.txt)
(**2026-11-14 20:59:47 Asia/Shanghai**). Verbatim highlights:

| Fact | PASS host |
| --- | --- |
| `/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` | file not present (Linux 6.12) |
| `/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces` | `63991` |
| `/proc/sys/kernel/apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` | file not present |
| `/sys/module/apparmor/parameters/enabled` | file not present |
| naive `bwrap --unshare-all -- /bin/true` | exit **1**, `execvp /bin/true: No such file or directory` |
| naive `bwrap --unshare-all -- /usr/bin/true` | exit **1**, same `execvp` ENOENT (`/usr/bin/true` exists on the host) |
| `bwrap --unshare-all --ro-bind / / -- /usr/bin/true` | exit **0** |
| official `sandbox_command(..., probe=True)` | `{"ready": True}` |

The naive `/bin/true` command is **not** the official qualify preflight.
On this bubblewrap 0.12.0, the sandbox root is empty until paths are bound,
so the naive command fails with `execvp` ENOENT **on the same host that
already produced a qualify PASS**. Do not treat a naive-probe failure as
proof that this host cannot qualify, and do not treat a naive-probe success
on another host as a complete diagnosis.

## What is still not shown

A later review run at the same git tree (`8b4a0cf` / `03a6a62`), on Linux /
Python 3.12.14 / bubblewrap 0.12.0, reported the official preflight failure
(`SandboxUnavailable` / empty controls). The tree is the same; the **host
sandbox capability** is not. Common causes of *that* official-probe error,
given that `bwrap` itself is installed:

1. Unprivileged user namespaces are disabled or exhausted
   (`/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` is `0` when that file
   exists, or `/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces` is `0`), or the process
   is already inside a container/user namespace that cannot nest
   `--unshare-all`.
2. `/usr/bin/python3` is missing, is not a `python3.X` CPython, or the
   corresponding `/usr/lib/python3.X` stdlib (and a lib64/multiarch lib dir)
   is not present. The sandbox binds **system** Python only; a conda/venv
   or `/usr/local` interpreter used to *launch* qualify does not get mounted
   inside bwrap. Python 3.12 vs 3.13 is fine if `/usr/bin/python3` and its
   stdlib resolve; it is not fine if launch Python is 3.12 from a prefix
   that is not the system layout the sandbox expects.
3. LSM / userns restrictions (AppArmor, Debian
   `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns`, etc.) that allow `bwrap`
   to exist but cause `--unshare-all` or the official probe process to fail.

This pack now shows which of those facts hold on the PASS host. It does
**not** show which one applies on the failing review host. The difference
is demonstrated only when that host posts the same
`reproduce.py preflight-diag --repo <archive-of-8b4a0cf-or-03a6a62>`
output.

Diagnostic (no sysctl change required to *run the diagnosis*):

```bash
python3 docs/reviews/pr437-s01-reproduction/reproduce.py preflight-diag \
  --repo .
# or, from a git archive of 8b4a0cf / 03a6a62:
# python3 docs/reviews/pr437-s01-reproduction/reproduce.py preflight-diag --repo "$ARCHIVE"
```

This pack does **not** recommend weakening the sandbox or enabling host
fallback. If official preflight fails on a reviewer host, treat that run as
INCONCLUSIVE and compare the `preflight-diag` facts to the attached PASS
receipt rather than treating the two qualify verdicts as a content
disagreement on `8b4a0cf` / `03a6a62`. Later pack-only commits (including
`1132040` and any follow-up that only edits this directory) are **not**
tree-identical to `8b4a0cf`.
